Today we are launching a [mini-site featuring our collection of short stories inspired by new developments in machine learning](https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/).   Beginning with our fourth report, we started including a science-fiction story along with the technical and strategic overviews that are the bulk of each report. Using these stories, we can look at the technologies we profile from a different angle and explore their cultural implications.

The [SciFi site](https://scifi.fastforwardlabs.com/) includes the four stories we have included so far. We will continue to commission and publish a story with each new report, and we are working on plans to open the process up to a wider range of voices.
