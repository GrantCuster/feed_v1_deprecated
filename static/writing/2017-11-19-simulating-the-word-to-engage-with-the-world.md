title: "Simulating the World to Engage with the World"

I wanted to collect some threads here as I read and explore procedural
generation more. I have been thinking about how engaging with
(either playing or creating) a simulation of the world encourages stronger engagement with the actual world. Some examples:

- Ethan Edwards write-up in [_Seeds_](http://www.procjam.com/seeds/) issue 2 of
  his project [Edge of the Sphere](http://ethanedwards.org/) which uses an
iPhone camera and edge detection to produce a stylized view of the world and
generate tones to go with it. He talks about how after exploring and developing
an understanding of what types of shapes from the world produce interesting
tones in the app, you can leave the app and that understanding where still hang
around in your mind, layered into your view of the world, enriching your
experience of it a bit.
- [This
  article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/the-algorithms-behind-moanas-gorgeously-animated-pacific-ocean/528645/)
on the water effects in the film Moana. Which ends with a quote from Erin Ramos,
the effects lead:

  > “You know it’s hard for me to go to the beach nowadays,” she said. “When I’m
  > there, I’m looking at how foam dissipates, at how the water recedes back into
  > the ocean, the cadence and the rhythm of the little breaks. I’m looking at how
  > the beach itself is modeled to create the reef breaks, how the light affects
  > the water, the clarity of the water itself, the colors. There’s just a million
  > things going through my head.”
  >
  > “I don’t think it’s a bad thing,” she added. “I think it’s gorgeous.”

  I identify with that feeling. It's one of the reasons I'm most interested in
  exploring procedural generation myself. Aspects of the world I've taken for
granted (especially those built up through natural processes) become much more
interesting to me when I'm trying to imagine how to set up a system of forces to
simulate them. One thing I enjoy about graphic design is the constant
looking-out for inspiration, like in the lettering of shop windows, for example.
This feels to me like that, but with a much wider range of things to draw
inspiration from. (And, yes, probably I should also spend some time thinking about why I need to
dissect and recreate something to appreciate it.)

I didn't consciously put it together this way, but those threads are good
motivation for why I should keep working on my backyard simulator. Which aims to
be a simplified simulation of some of the natural systems (plants) of our
backyard and our (Me, Parvoneh, Prince the dog, Ernie the cat) within it.
Working on the simulation will hopefully make me engaged and appreciative when
I'm in the real thing.
