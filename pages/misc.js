Experimental projects at varying stages of completion.
- [Dates](/dates) (10/8/2017) - A page to help me remember important dates and how long I've been doing certain things.
- The City and the City - An experiment in terrain generation and possibly game development.
	- [v1](/cityand/v1) (8/5/2017) - Terrain generates and people move around.
	- [v2](/cityand/v2) (8/12/2017) - People crossing paths and saying excuse me.
- [Project Ideas](/project_ideas) (7/6/2017) - A list of personal project ideas.
- [Feed Archive View](/feed_archive) (7/1/2017) - An alternate view of the feed, where post thumbnails are grouped by month. It loads a lot of images at once so proceed with caution if you're paying for data.
